##Understanding

###Implied Probability
This is calculated using the sports book’s odds. This is the probability that the sports book’s have as it includes a certain percentage on top of the true probability.

###Vigorish/Overage
This is a small percentage (usually around 0-10%) that is used as guaranteed profit added onto the true odds/probability of an event.

###True probability
This is the probability of the bet when the vigorish is taken out of the total percentage.

###True Odds
Using the true probability, we are able to see what the actual odds of either side of the bet hitting is.
###Expected Value
This is the expected amount you will make (percentage) on a bet. It is calculated by multiplying the expected winning by the true probability, and then subtracting the value of the money you would lose by the probability of the bet losing.
